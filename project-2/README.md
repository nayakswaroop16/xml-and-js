## Project 2

* My data consists of id, animal common name, animal scientific name and country of origin. 
* I created a controller which has getById and getAll functions.
* I have 3 textboxes and a dropdown to filter data by each field.
* The form also contains apply and reset buttons.
* When the user clicks on apply button the data in the form is fetched and passed to the getAll function. The getAll function then fetches the data and applies the filters that were passed to it.
* The data returned by getAll function is then used to render the table.
